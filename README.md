# 🧠 NeetCode 150 Challenge (Python)

Welcome to my personal journey through the **NeetCode 150** challenge! This repository contains structured solutions to each of the 150 hand-picked LeetCode problems compiled by NeetCode, aimed at mastering data structures and algorithms for coding interviews.

## 🚀 Goal

- Solve all 150 problems using **Python**
- For each problem:
  - Create a dedicated folder
  - Include the **problem description** (`README.md`)
  - Write **brute-force** and/or **optimal** Python solutions
  - Document **time and space complexity**

## 📁 Folder Structure

├── 01_two_sum/
│ ├── README.md # Problem description
│ ├── brute_force.py # Brute-force solution
│ └── optimal.py # Optimal solution
├── 02_valid_parentheses/
